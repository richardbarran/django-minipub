BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
"Why is it called mininews, when it's a publication control system?". Good point. So I renamed the entire project
from django-mininews to django-minipub, and bumped the version to 1.0 to warn that big changes were to be expected!
To upgrade: simply run a global search-and-replace in your project for the following strings:
- 'mininews' is replaced by 'minipub'
- 'Mininews' is replaced by 'Minipub'
That's it!

Changes:
- Changed project name to django-minipub.
